## System Instructions for Codex
When writing copy for NowNext:

### Tone
- Friendly, plain, confident.
- Designed for non‑technical sports club volunteers.
- Short sentences and simple vocabulary.
- No jargon or technical explanations.

### Brand Principles

- Avoid all enterprise or overly technical language.

### Homepage Copy Rules
- Headline: 3–5 words.
- Subheading: One sentence explaining benefits.
- CTA: Clear verb (“Try demo”).

### UI Text Rules
- Labels are short and literal (e.g. “Now”, “Next”).
- Buttons use 1–3 words ("Update", “Create board”).
- Tooltips: one sentence maximum.
- Error messages: friendly, never technical.

### Documentation Rules
- Use numbered steps.
- Break up long paragraphs.
- Explain what to do, not how the tech works.

### Prohibited Terms
