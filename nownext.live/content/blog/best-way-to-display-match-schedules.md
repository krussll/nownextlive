# The Best Way to Display Match Schedules at Your Club or Event

Picture this: it's tournament day at your club. Players are huddled around a whiteboard covered in crossed-out names and scribbled changes. Someone asks "Am I on next?" for the third time in ten minutes. Your volunteer coordinator is frantically rewriting court assignments with a marker that's running out of ink. Sound familiar?

Many clubs still rely on printed sheets or handwritten whiteboards to show who is playing next. These methods become inaccurate the moment the first match runs late, creating avoidable confusion and frustration. Players crowd around noticeboards looking for updates, and volunteers spend most of the day rewriting information instead of actually running the event.

There's a better way. Modern clubs are moving to digital schedule displays because they make communication simple, accurate and instant. No more crossed-out names, no more "what court am I on?", and no more volunteers chained to a whiteboard all day.

This guide explains the problems with traditional noticeboards and shows you exactly how to create a clear, live-updating match display using NowNext.live—even if you've never set up anything like this before.

## Why Traditional Noticeboards Fail

Let's be honest about what's not working with the old methods:

### Paper goes out of date immediately

Once a schedule is printed, it's already outdated. The first match runs five minutes late? Your entire printed schedule is now wrong. A player calls in sick? Time to reprint everything or start scribbling changes. Any delay or change breaks the flow of the day, and printed schedules can't adapt.

The problem compounds throughout the day. By mid-afternoon, your pristine morning schedule is a mess of annotations, arrows, and asterisks that only the person who wrote them can decipher.

### Handwritten updates become messy

Whiteboards seem like a flexible solution until you're actually using one during a busy event. They quickly fill with crossed-out names, squeezed-in additions, and unclear changes. Different people have different handwriting. Someone erases a bit too much. The marker smudges.

Players misread information and ask volunteers for clarification, which defeats the entire purpose of having a visible schedule. What started as a clear display becomes an indecipherable puzzle that creates more questions than it answers.

### Players ask "Am I on next?"

If the display isn't clear, visible, and trustworthy, players will repeatedly interrupt organisers for updates. This creates a frustrating cycle: volunteers are too busy answering questions to update the board, which means the board gets more out of date, which means more questions.

Your volunteers didn't sign up to be human information desks. They want to help run a great event, not spend all day repeating the same information.

### Volunteers lose valuable time

Here's the real cost: most of the volunteer's day is spent correcting the board instead of running the event. Time spent rewriting schedules is time not spent greeting players, managing logistics, or handling the hundred other things that make an event run smoothly.

Calculate the hours: if a volunteer spends 15 minutes every hour updating a whiteboard during an 8-hour event, that's 2 full hours of wasted effort. Multiply that by multiple volunteers and multiple events, and you're looking at hundreds of hours per year spent on manual schedule updates.

## Benefits of Digital Match Displays

Digital displays solve all these problems and add benefits you might not have considered:

### Always accurate

A single update refreshes every screen instantly. Change a court assignment in the controller? It appears on the TV in the clubhouse, the tablet at the desk, and every player's phone within seconds. No reprinting, no rewriting, no confusion.

This real-time accuracy means players trust the display. They stop asking questions because they know the information is current. That trust is invaluable during a busy event.

### Clear and easy to read

Digital displays use consistent formatting and high-contrast layouts that work from across the room. No more squinting at handwriting or trying to figure out if that's a "Court 3" or "Court 8". 

The formatting stays perfect all day. Names don't get smudged. Times don't get accidentally erased. Everything remains crisp and readable from the moment you open the display until the last match finishes.

### Reduces crowding

When players can check the schedule from anywhere—on their phones, on multiple screens around the venue, or on a large TV—they don't all crowd around a single noticeboard. This improves flow around your venue and reduces the bottleneck at the information desk.

Players can check their next match from the café, from the practice courts, or from the car park. They stay informed without getting in anyone's way.

### Works on any device

TVs, laptops, tablets, or monitors—if it has a browser, it works. You don't need to buy special equipment or install complicated software. Use whatever screens you already have available.

This flexibility means you can have displays in multiple locations: a large TV in the main hall, a tablet at the registration desk, and a laptop in the office, all showing the same live information.

### Looks professional

A modern digital display gives your club a clean, organised feel. It shows players that you're running a professional operation. First impressions matter, and a sleek digital schedule makes a much better impression than a messy whiteboard.

This professional appearance can help attract new members, sponsors, and events. Clubs that look organised tend to be organised, and digital displays are a visible sign of that organisation.

## Step by Step: How to Display Schedules Using NowNext.live

Ready to set up your own digital schedule display? Here's exactly how to do it. The entire process takes about 10 minutes, even if you've never done anything like this before.

### Step 1: Create or Open an Event

![NowNext.live Controller](/imgs/demos/nownextlive-controller.png)

First, you need to create your event in NowNext.live:

1. **Log in to NowNext.live** at [nownext.live](https://nownext.live)
2. **Create a new event** by clicking the "Create Event" button, or open an existing event from your dashboard
3. **A default layout is created automatically**—you'll see a basic structure ready for you to customize

Give your event a clear name like "Saturday Club Championships" or "Junior Tournament March 2025". This helps you find it later if you're running multiple events.

The system creates a unique URL for your event that you'll use for both controlling the schedule and displaying it on screens. Keep this URL handy—you'll need it in the next steps.

### Step 2: Add Your Courts or Rinks

![Add spaces for courts](/imgs/demos/nownextlive-controller.png)

Now let's add your playing areas. In NowNext.live, these are called "Spaces"—they could be courts, rinks, pitches, or any area where matches happen:

1. **Open the Spaces section** in your event controller
2. **Select "Add Space"** for each playing area you have
3. **Name each playing area** clearly—"Court 1", "Court 2", "Main Rink", etc.
4. **Drag to reorder** them if you want them to appear in a specific sequence on the display

Pro tip: name your spaces exactly as they're labeled in your venue. If your courts are labeled "A", "B", "C" in real life, use those same labels in the system. This prevents confusion when players are looking for their court.

You can add as many spaces as you need. Running a tournament with 8 courts? Add all 8. Just using 2 rinks for a small event? Add just those 2. The display adapts automatically.

### Step 3: Add Sessions or Rounds

Now for the actual schedule—the sessions or rounds of play:

1. **Open the Sessions section** in your event controller
2. **Select "Add Session"** for each round, time block, or match you want to schedule
3. **Enter round names and match information**—this could be "Round 1", "Semi Finals", "10:00 AM Block", or whatever makes sense for your event
4. **Drag to reorder sessions** to match your actual schedule flow

Each session can contain details like:
- Match names or numbers
- Player names or team names
- Start times
- Which space (court/rink) it's assigned to
- Any notes or special information

Don't worry about getting everything perfect immediately. You can edit, add, or remove sessions at any time, even during the event. That's the beauty of a digital system—it's always flexible.

### Step 4: Open the Display View

![NowNext.live Display](/imgs/demos/nownextlive-display.png)

Now let's see what your players will see:

1. **Select "Open Display"** from your event controller
2. **The layout loads in a large screen-friendly view**—optimized for TVs and monitors
3. **All changes appear instantly**—try editing a session in the controller and watch it update on the display in real-time

The display view is designed to be clear and readable from a distance. It uses large text, high contrast, and a clean layout that highlights what's happening now and what's coming next.

This is the view you'll show on your public screens. It's read-only, so players can't accidentally change anything if they access it on their phones.

### Step 5: Show It on a Screen

Here's where the magic happens—getting your schedule onto screens:

**Open the Display Link on:**
- **Smart TVs**—just open the browser app and enter your display URL
- **Laptops**—perfect for registration desks or smaller viewing areas
- **Tablets**—great for portable displays you can move around
- **Any connected screen**—if it can show a web page, it can show your schedule

**Quick setup tips:**
- Put the display in full-screen mode (usually F11 on computers) to hide browser toolbars
- Adjust the screen brightness so it's readable in your venue's lighting
- If using a TV, make sure it won't go to sleep—adjust the power settings
- Consider setting the display URL as the browser's homepage so it loads automatically

You can have the same display open on multiple screens simultaneously. Many clubs set up a large TV in the main hall, a tablet at the registration desk, and share the URL with players so they can check on their phones.

### Step 6: Update During Play

This is where digital displays really shine. As your event progresses, you can make changes that appear everywhere instantly:

**Changes you can make in real-time:**
- **Match results**—mark matches as complete or add scores
- **Changing courts**—move a match to a different space if needed
- **Adjusting timings**—push back a session that's running late
- **Adding or removing sessions**—adapt to player withdrawals or additions

Make these changes from the controller view on your laptop, tablet, or phone. Every connected display updates within seconds. No announcements needed, no whiteboard updates, no confusion.

**Real-world example:** A match is running 20 minutes late. In the old system, you'd need to rewrite the entire schedule. With NowNext.live, you adjust the start time of the next session, and every screen updates instantly. Players see the change on their phones and adjust accordingly. Crisis averted.

## Real-World Success Stories

Clubs using digital schedule displays report significant improvements:

- **Fewer interruptions:** Volunteers report 70-80% fewer "what's happening next?" questions
- **Time savings:** Events run more smoothly with less time spent on schedule management
- **Player satisfaction:** Players appreciate always having accurate information at their fingertips
- **Professional image:** Clubs report that digital displays make a strong impression on visitors and potential sponsors

One club coordinator told us: *"We used to have two people just managing the whiteboard all day. Now one person can handle the entire schedule from a tablet while also greeting players and managing other tasks. It's been transformative."*

## FAQ

### Do I need a smart TV?

No! Any screen with a web browser works. This includes:
- Regular computers or laptops
- Tablets (iPad, Android tablets, etc.)
- Smart TVs with built-in browsers
- Regular TVs connected to a laptop or streaming device
- Even old monitors connected to a Raspberry Pi

If you can open a web page on it, you can display your schedule on it.

### Can multiple screens display the same schedule?

Yes! This is one of the best features. You can have the same schedule displayed on:
- A large TV in the main hall
- A tablet at the registration desk  
- A laptop in the office
- Players' personal phones

All of them show the same information and all update in real-time when you make changes. There's no limit to how many screens can display the same event.

### Can this be used for non-racket sports?

Absolutely! While many of our users run tennis, squash, and badminton events, NowNext.live works brilliantly for:
- **Bowls** tournaments
- **Football** or soccer leagues
- **Athletics** meets with multiple events
- **Swimming** competitions
- **Multi-activity** events with different sports happening simultaneously
- **Esports** tournaments
- **Conference** schedules with multiple rooms
- Any event where you need to show "what's happening where and when"

The system is sport-agnostic. If you need to schedule activities across multiple spaces, it works.

### How much does it cost?

NowNext.live offers a free tier that's perfect for small clubs and occasional events. Paid plans add features like unlimited events, custom branding, and advanced scheduling tools. Check [nownext.live/pricing](https://nownext.live/pricing) for current pricing.

### What if my internet connection is unreliable?

The display is designed to be resilient. Once loaded, it will continue showing the current schedule even if the connection drops briefly. When the connection returns, it automatically syncs any changes.

For venues with very poor internet, consider using a mobile hotspot or setting up a dedicated connection just for the display screens.

### Can players access the schedule on their phones?

Yes! You can share the display URL with players, and they can check the schedule on their personal devices. This is completely optional—some clubs prefer to only show it on venue screens, while others love giving players direct access.

The display URL is read-only, so players can view but not edit the schedule.

### How long does setup take?

For a typical club tournament:
- Initial event creation: 2 minutes
- Adding courts/spaces: 1-2 minutes
- Adding sessions: 5-10 minutes (depending on complexity)
- Setting up displays: 2-3 minutes

Total: **10-15 minutes** for your first event. Once you're familiar with the system, you can set up a new event in under 5 minutes.

### Can I prepare the schedule in advance?

Yes! Create your event days or weeks in advance, set up all your sessions, and have everything ready to go. On event day, just open the display and start updating match results as they happen.

Many clubs create template events for recurring tournaments, making setup even faster.

## Conclusion: Time to Upgrade Your Schedule Display

Traditional noticeboards and printed schedules served us well for decades, but they're no longer the best tool for the job. Digital displays are easier to manage, more accurate, more professional, and—most importantly—they save your volunteers countless hours of frustration.

The technology isn't complicated or expensive. You don't need special equipment or technical expertise. If you can use a web browser, you can run a digital schedule display.

**Ready to give it a try?** Head over to [NowNext.live](https://nownext.live) and create your first event. It's free to start, takes less than 15 minutes to set up, and you'll wonder how you ever managed without it.

Your volunteers will thank you. Your players will thank you. And you'll spend less time managing schedules and more time enjoying the event.
