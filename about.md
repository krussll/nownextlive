  <h1>The crew behind the countdown</h1>
  <p>
    We build tools that let production teams stay calm under pressure. Inspired by the clean
    minimalism of professional stage timers, Now Next Live pairs clarity with adaptability for
    every event environment.

    The platform started as a simple timer app created for a local performing arts venue. After
    seeing how crews hacked it into their workflows, we began shaping a system that could power
    larger events without losing the focus that made the original tool loved.

  <p>
    Today, our distributed team supports productions across continents. We design features with
    stage managers, audio engineers, lighting leads, and streaming directors so every role has what
    they need at a glance.

    "The best compliment we receive is when a caller tells us they forgot the software was even
    there. That's when we know we've done our job."

  <p>
    Away from the control room, we stay curious about new storytelling formats, accessibility
    advances, and ways to create more human moments in hybrid events. The countdown continues, and
    we're thrilled to keep building alongside you.
