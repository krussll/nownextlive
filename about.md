      The platform started as a simple timer app created for a local performing arts venue. After seeing how crews hacked it into their workflows, we began shaping a system that could power larger events without losing the focus that made the original tool loved.

      Today, our distributed team supports productions across continents. We design features with stage managers, audio engineers, lighting leads, and streaming directors so every role has what they need at a glance.

      Away from the control room, we stay curious about new storytelling formats, accessibility advances, and ways to create more human moments in hybrid events. The countdown continues, and we're thrilled to keep building alongside you.
