        <p>
          Not all countdowns are created equal. These three timers keep our crew
          synchronized across show callers, broadcast leads, and clients.

          The stage timer is the anchor. It's visible to presenters, reflects the
          agenda everyone agreed on, and acts as the heartbeat of the event. We
          keep its typography bold and legible from across the stage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Behind the scenes, the control room timer handles transitions, media
          loads, and operator cues. It often runs a few beats ahead so we can
          anticipate action before it hits the stage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, the client timer offers transparency. Whether they're in the
          green room or joining remotely, they can see we're on track without
          needing to tap the production team for updates.
