summary: Not all countdowns are created equal. These three timers keep our crew synchronized across show callers, broadcast leads, and clients.

The stage timer is the anchor. It's visible to presenters, reflects the agenda everyone agreed on, and acts as the heartbeat of the event. We keep its typography bold and legible from across the stage.

Behind the scenes, the control room timer handles transitions, media loads, and operator cues. It often runs a few beats ahead so we can anticipate action before it hits the stage.

Finally, the client timer offers transparency. Whether they're in the green room or joining remotely, they can see we're on track without needing to tap the production team for updates.
