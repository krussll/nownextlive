summary: A calm presenter delivers a clear message. Here's how our stage crew sets the tone from the moment they walk backstage.

Every show begins with a welcome lap. We introduce each presenter to the caller, confirm how they prefer to receive cues, and point out the timers they'll see on the confidence monitor. Simple rituals shrink the distance between the crew and the person on stage.

We then walk through the "now, next, later" structure that keeps everyone aligned. Presenters know which slide transitions the operator handles, when to expect a time warning, and what backup options exist if the unexpected happens.

> Confidence is built in quiet corners. Giving presenters space to ask questions keeps the energy grounded long before the countdown begins.

Finally, we rehearse the first 60 seconds. Even if we only have a few minutes, this quick run-through allows presenters to feel their pacing and see how the timer responds. By the time they step into the lights, we're aligned and ready to deliver a seamless moment.
