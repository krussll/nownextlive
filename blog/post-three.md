title: Lighting cues that support remote audiences

summary: Hybrid shows introduce lighting challenges that extend beyond the stage. Here's how we program cues for cameras and viewers everywhere.

We begin by mapping every camera angle and noting where spill might occur. Our timers trigger cues that adjust brightness right before a remote-only segment so the broadcast feed remains balanced.

For interactive moments, we introduce soft pulses of color that sync with the countdown. Remote viewers feel the energy building without the harsh flicker that can distract in person.

Finally, we program a cool-down cue that lands as soon as the host wraps a segment. It gives the production team breathing room to reset while keeping the broadcast signal clean for transitions and overlays.
