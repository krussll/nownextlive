        <h1>Building trust with presenters before they go live</h1>
        <p>
          A calm presenter delivers a clear message. Here's how our stage crew
          sets the tone from the moment they walk backstage.

        <p>
          Every show begins with a welcome lap. We introduce each presenter to
          the caller, confirm how they prefer to receive cues, and point out the
          timers they'll see on the confidence monitor. Simple rituals shrink the
          distance between the crew and the person on stage.
        </p>
        <p>
          We then walk through the "now, next, later" structure that keeps
          everyone aligned. Presenters know which slide transitions the operator
          handles, when to expect a time warning, and what backup options exist if
          the unexpected happens.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          Confidence is built in quiet corners. Giving presenters space to ask
          questions keeps the energy grounded long before the countdown begins.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Finally, we rehearse the first 60 seconds. Even if we only have a few
          minutes, this quick run-through allows presenters to feel their pacing
          and see how the timer responds. By the time they step into the lights,
          we're aligned and ready to deliver a seamless moment.
